Which output – obtained in 3(a) or in 2(a) – better characterizes the documents? Give reasons for your answers?

Output obtained in 3(a) better characterizes the documents. This is because
as 2(a) removes all the words which are repeated once or twice, the important
words are being removed which will repeat less no. of times.
Hence all the stop words which repeat more no. of times in the documents are 
being shown in the output.
In case of 3(a) it is considering even the rare words.
